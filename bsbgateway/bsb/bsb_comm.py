class BsbComm(EventSource):
    '''simplifies the conversion between serial data and BsbTelegrams.
    BsbComm represents one or multiple BSB bus endpoint(s). You can
    send and receive BsbTelegrams. 
    
    Wrapper around the serial source: instead of raw data,
    the parsed telegrams are returned. Event payload is a list of tuples:
        [(which_address, BsbTelegram), (which_address, BsbTelegram) ...].
    which address gives the index of the bus address where the telegram came in
    (0 for first) - None if the telegram was not intended for this endpoint.
    
    Functions for sending:
        * send_get: sends a telegram requesting the disp_id's value
        * send_set: sends a telegram setting the value for disp_id.
        
    Also supports sniffing (i.e. catching messages for other endpoints). 
    Set sniffmode=True for this. Can be toggled while running.
