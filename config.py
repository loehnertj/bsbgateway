# Device configuration

# Type of connected device. Currently there is only a (incomplete) driver for Broetje ISR Plus.
# Read "driver" = "index of available fields".
device = 'broetje_isr_plus'

# Settings for the used adapter.
adapter_settings = {
    # * '/dev/ttyS0' ... '/dev/ttyS3' are usual devices for real serial ports.
    # * '/dev/ttyUSB0' is the usual device for a USB-to-serial converter on Linux.
    # * ':sim' opens a simple device simulation (no actual serial port required)
    'adapter_device': ':sim',
    #'adapter_device': '/dev/ttyUSB0',

    # 'odd' or 'even'. For BSB: 'odd' if you invert bytes (see below), 'even' if not.
    'port_parity': 'odd',
    # flip all bits after receive + before send. If you use a simple BSB-to-UART
    # level converter, you most probably need to set this to True.
    'invert_bytes': True,
    # Only send if CTS has this state (True or False); None to disable.
    # Use this if your adapter has a "bus in use" detection wired to CTS pin of the RS232 interface.

# Bus adress offset of Gateway. Allowed range: 11 ... 125.

# This address + 2 for webinterface requests

# blocking up the bus when lots of requests come in at once.

# more than (3.0 / min_wait_s) requests at once, the last ones will timeout.
